The building has four stories and more than twenty rooms and eighty windows. It is reported to be the most haunted house in Ohio. The house was built in 1881-1883 by the famed architectural firm of Cudell & Richardson for Hannes Tiedemann, a prosperous German immigrant. On January 15, 1891, his fifteen-year-old daughter Emma Tiedemann succumbed to diabetes. The house saw its second death not long afterwards when Tiedemann''s elderly mother, Wiebeka, died. During the next three years the Tiedemanns would bury three more children, giving rise to speculation that there was more to the deaths than met the eye.<br>For more information: <a href = "https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/531"</a>'

The cemetery was established in 1826 and was the city''s first permanent cemetery, replacing a community burial ground just south of Public Square. The most known ghost here is that of Joc-O-Sot, a native Meskwaki whose mysteriously cracked tombstone has been attributed to distress regarding his inability to return to his tribe. Another local legend recognizes the tombstone''s vandals, but states they were supernaturally punished with insanity as a result of a curse place by Oghema Niagara. For several years three stalks of maize would grow beside Joc-O-Sot''s grave, attributed to a Sauk tribe member who visited regularly. The ghost of Joc-O-Scot has been held responsible by the superstitious for losses by the Cleveland Indians baseball team.<br>For more information: <a href = "https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/319"</a>'

Squire and located in the North Chagrin Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks. In 1890, Squire purchased 525 acres of forest land east of Cleveland, which he planned to turn into an English country estate complete with manor house. About 1895, Squire began construction on a gatekeeper''s house. The structure was completed about 1897, but was the only structure ever completed. Squire and his daughter used the gatekeeper''s house as an occasional weekend country home.
A myth about the structure has grown up over the years regarding Squire''s wife Louisa, who woke one night at the house during a storm and went downstairs to investigate a noise. Startled by lightning , she fell down the stairs and broke her neck. According to this legend, her ghost can be seen floating through Squire''s Castle."

It was the city’s second-oldest black-owned funeral home. The House of Wills served primarily black families but directed the funerals of people of many backgrounds. Into the middle decades of the 20th century, when most comparable public facilities barred African Americans, the House of Wills offered a regular meeting place for social clubs, music recitals, civil rights activities, and other black community gatherings. The building previously served as a hospital for Hungarin Immigrants for 14 years and as the Cleveland Hebrew Institute for 18 years before becoming the House of Wills. Reports of ghosts include a figure standing at an upstairs window, voices in empty rooms, and moving shadows.<br>For more information: <a href = "https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/911"</a>'

Donald MacIntosh purchased the tavern in 1820 and operated it as the Cleveland House and later the City Hotel until it was destroyed by fire in 1845. In 1848, it was rebuilt as the Dunham House, which was enlarged in 1852 and renamed the Forest City House. That structure was demolished in 1916 to make way for the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel. The hotel has superficial connections to the Cleveland Torso Murders and Eliot Ness, but most of the reports of strange activity occur on the fourth floor.

She is now a National Historic Landmark, preserved as a memorial and museum ship permanently moored in Cleveland. During WWII, a crewman famously and correctly foretold his death to his crewmates and since its decomissioning there have been reports of strange shapes appearing in photographs and visitors hearing footsteps. The Cod is a regular part of local ghost tours.<br>For more information: <a href = "http://usscod.org/"</a>'

  description: '<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Ohio_State_Reformatory-13.jpg" width="200" class="verticalcenter"><br>The Ohio State Reformatory, also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, is an historic prison located in Mansfield, Ohio. It was built between 1886 and 1910 and remained in operation until 1990, when a United States Federal Court ruling ordered the facility to be closed. As the result of a prisoners'' class action suit citing overcrowding and inhumane conditions (Boyd v. Denton, C.A. 78-1054A (N.D.Oh.)), District Judge Frank J. Battisti ordered the prison closed by the end of December 1986. The Mansfield Reformatory has a long reputation in the Greater Cleveland area as one of the most haunted buildings and is regularly visited by people looking for a paranormal experience. Everything from hearing voices and seeing ghosts to moving objects and being physically touched has been reported here.<br>For more information: <a href = "https://www.mrps.org/paranormal"</a>'
