About 1895, Squire began construction on a gatekeepers house. The structure was completed about 1897, but was the only structure ever completed. Squire and his daughter used the gatekeepers house as an occasional weekend country home.  A myth about the structure has grown up over the years regarding Squires wife Louisa, who woke one night at the house during a storm and went downstairs to investigate a noise.
