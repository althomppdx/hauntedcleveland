On January 15, 1891, Tiedemanns fifteen-year-old daughter Emma succumbed to diabetes. The house saw its second death not long afterwards when Tiedemanns elderly mother, Wiebeka, died.

Donald MacIntosh purchased the tavern in 1820 and operated it as the Cleveland House and later the City Hotel until it was destroyed by fire in 1845. In 1848, it was rebuilt as the Dunham House, which was enlarged in 1852 and renamed the Forest City House. That structure was demolished in 1916 to make way for the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel. The hotel has superficial connections to the Cleveland Torso Murders and Eliot Ness, but most of the reports of strange activity occur on the fourth floor. People have experienced doors slamming, toilets flushing by themselves, and occasionally seen ghosts entering vacant rooms.</p>'
